# Edge-AI-Real-Time-PPE-Violation-Detection-and-MCB-Shutdown
This project implements a real-time PPE violation detection system using Raspberry Pi 4 and ESP32. A YOLOv8 model processes live video to detect missing safety gear, triggering a servo-actuated MCB shutdown via ESP32, ensuring immediate response and enhancing industrial safety.
